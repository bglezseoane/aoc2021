My solutions to the Advent of Code 2021
===================================

*Author: Borja GonzÃ¡lez-Seoane*

This repository contains my particular solutions for the Advent of Code 2021 event. For more information, consult the event website \[[1]\].

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other. \[[1]\]

This year I have decided to solve the puzzles using Python. Each directory in this repository will contain the solution for a specific day. I am using Python 3.9.0 and I will left the requirements, if any, in the `requirements.txt` file.


## Advent checklist

Each day two puzzles are published. Two stars means that the two are resolved, one means that only the first part is, and none means that no puzzle was completed for that day.

| Day | Result |
| --- | ------ |
|  1  |   **   |
